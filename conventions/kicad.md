## 1 Background

Devops and management of KiCad projects and libraries (symbols, footprints and
3D model) are crucial to maintaining proper design practices.

---

## 2 Project Templates

Use of the KiCad project template is highly recommended as it contains GitHub
actions workflows to ensure correct design and variant releases.

The project template is managed
here: [kicad_template](https://github.com/danielljeon/kicad_template).

## 3 Internal Component Libraries

A standardized GitHub repo is used to maintain the internal component library.
This repo is also configured with GitHub actions workflows to ensure component
accuracy.

Libraries are managed
here: [pcb_library](https://github.com/danielljeon/component_library).
